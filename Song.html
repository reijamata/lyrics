         <h3>"I Choose"</h3>
         <p>All of my life<br>
          I thought I was right<br>
          Looking for something new<br>
          Stuck in my ways<br>
          Like old-fashioned days<br>
          But all the roads led me to you<br>
        </p>
  
        <p>The house that you live in don't make it a home<br>
         But feeling lonely don't mean you're alone<br>
         People in life, they will come and they'll leave<br>
         But if I had a choice I know where I would be<br>
         </p>
		 
        <p>Through the lows and the highs I will stay by your side<br>
        There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light<br>
        When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say<br>
        At the end of the day I choose you<br>
         </p>
		 
		 <p>Now I found the strength<br>
         To make a change<br>
         And look at the magic I found<br>
         No matter the name<br>
         Or where you came from<br>
        'Cause no one has much figured out<br>
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>The house that you live in don't make it a home<br>
         But feeling lonely don't mean you're alone<br>
         I finally found where I feel I belong<br>
         And I know you'll be there with wide open arms<br>
         </p>
		 
		 <p>Through the lows and the highs I will stay by your side<br>
         There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light<br>
         When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say<br>
         At the end of the day I choose you<br>
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>I choose you<br>
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>Through the lows and the highs I will stay by your side<br>
         There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light<br>
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>Through the lows and the highs I will stay by your side<br>
         There's no need for goodbyes, now I'm seeing the light<br>
         When the sky turns to grey and there's nothing to say<br>
         At the end of the day I choose you<br>
         Oh, I choose you<br>
